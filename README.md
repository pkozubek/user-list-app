Your task is to create a simple app that adds or remove users from the list

Users should provide an email, nickname and IP address

Email and IP address validation

Add button should be disabled if validation does not pass

If user already exists (checked by email or nickname) the operation should be blocked

Each user should be removable by corresponding remove button

Removing entire list should be possible

Removal requires confirmation

Remove list button should not be visible while list is empty

Popups informing why adding a user is not possible

Sorting users list by nickname, email or date

Nice to have:

CSS styles
